# AAA

* Arrange - set up some condition or scenario
* Act - do something to trigger things
* Assert - test that the right behavior occurred

# DRY vs WET
* In order for a test case to have no dependencies, it must Arrange, Act and
  Assert all inside its test case
  * `explicit_everything_spec.rb`
* Huge fixtures that distract from the Act/Assert are probably worth extracting
* Fixtures and setups that assert contracts between models are probably worth
  extracting
* This is extraction for clarity, not DRY for the sake of removing duplication
